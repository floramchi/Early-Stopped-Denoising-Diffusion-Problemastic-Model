# ES-DDPM (Early Stopped Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models)

This repository implements **Early Stopped Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (ES-DDPM)**, a method combining diffusion models with early stopping strategies for efficient and accurate image generation. It is designed to leverage the power of generative models to produce high-quality images with reduced computational cost.
